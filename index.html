            <h3>1. IoT Device Testing & Debugging</h3>
            <p>
                As an IoT Test Engineer, I have been responsible for ensuring the reliability, security, and efficiency of IoT devices by designing and implementing rigorous testing methodologies. 
                My role involved developing comprehensive test plans that covered functional testing, performance evaluation, security assessments, and integration testing for connected devices. 
                I worked on debugging firmware issues, validating connectivity protocols such as MQTT and Modbus, and ensuring seamless data exchange across IoT networks. 
                A critical part of my responsibilities was to identify and resolve issues related to sensor calibration, power consumption, and wireless communication stability, ensuring optimized device performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I collaborated closely with embedded software engineers, cloud developers, and hardware teams to establish automated test suites for validating firmware updates. 
                By leveraging tools such as PlatformIO and Visual Studio Code, I ensured seamless firmware deployment and real-time debugging capabilities. 
                I also focused on improving device security by conducting penetration testing and ensuring secure firmware-over-the-air (FOTA) updates. 
                Through my contributions, I helped enhance product reliability, reduced system failures, and streamlined deployment workflows for IoT solutions in industrial applications.
            </p>
            
            <h3>2. Embedded System Validation</h3>
            <p>
                My role in embedded system validation encompassed end-to-end testing of microcontroller-based devices, ensuring compliance with industry standards and client-specific requirements. 
                I conducted extensive validation of embedded systems utilizing communication protocols such as UART, I2C, and SPI, ensuring proper data transmission between hardware components. 
                By implementing hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing methodologies, I was able to simulate real-world scenarios and validate system performance under various environmental conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my key responsibilities was conducting power efficiency tests to optimize energy consumption for battery-powered IoT devices. 
                I also worked on debugging embedded firmware issues by using serial communication logs and debugging tools. 
                Collaborating with cross-functional teams, I played a crucial role in refining software-hardware interactions, ensuring that embedded systems met design specifications and operated reliably in production environments.
            </p>
            
            <h3>3. Network Connectivity Testing</h3>
            <p>
                As part of my IoT engineering responsibilities, I specialized in testing network connectivity for IoT-enabled devices. 
                I validated connectivity reliability in challenging conditions such as low-signal environments, high-latency networks, and congested bandwidth scenarios. 
                My role involved testing the robustness of wireless communication protocols including Wi-Fi, LoRaWAN, and Bluetooth, ensuring uninterrupted data transmission and minimal packet loss.
            </p>
            <p>
                I developed simulation environments that replicated real-world connectivity issues to measure the resilience of IoT networks under stress conditions. 
                Through network diagnostics and performance analysis, I optimized communication efficiency by fine-tuning protocol configurations. 
                Additionally, I worked on troubleshooting network failures, implementing redundancy mechanisms, and ensuring IoT devices remained connected and functional in dynamic network environments.
